// M24C I2C serial EEPROM emulation for Genesis/Mega Drive cartridges.
//
// Ported from ares/component/eeprom/m24c/m24c.hpp and m24c.cpp.
// Used by cartridges that store saves on an I2C EEPROM (e.g. Light
// Crusader, Shadowrun, NBA Jam TE, WWF WrestleMania) instead of
// parallel SRAM. The EEPROM is accessed via SDA/SCL bit-banging
// through the cartridge's SRAM address range — the game writes SCL
// and SDA bit values to specific bit positions of word writes at the
// EEPROM address, and reads the SDA bit back from word reads.
//
// The M24C family covers X24C01 (128B) through M24C512 (64KB). The
// protocol is a simplified I2C state machine:
//   Standby → Device → [Bank] → Address → Read | Write
// Start condition: SDA falls while SCL is high.
// Stop condition:  SDA rises while SCL is high.
// Each byte is 9 clocks: 8 data bits (MSB first) + 1 ACK bit.
//
// Reference: ares/component/eeprom/m24c/m24c.cpp (207 LOC).
